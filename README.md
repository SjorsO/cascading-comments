# Laravel Cascading Comments
An index of Laravel's cascading comments.

## About
This is a cascading comment:

https://github.com/SjorsO/laravel-cascading-comments/blob/2002a252216907239460eafb31ca1666a10bc393/artisan#L26-L30

Each line is three characters shorter than the previous line. The last line is two characters shorter and ends with punctuation. If a comment follows these rules exactly, we consider it a "perfect" cascading comment.

These types of comments are everywhere in Laravel's source code.
The skeleton, framework, and most first-party packages have them.
This project finds and indexes all of these comments per Laravel release.
